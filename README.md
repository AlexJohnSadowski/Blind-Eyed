## Blind Eyed
### https://blindeyed.netlify.app/

#### Coming soon:
#### * better RWD
#### * adding more pages
#### * Adding GSAP (or I might stick to framer motion, but I rlly don't like using the observer, so probably will go with gsap 3)

Blind Eyed is a project created for an organisation that helps people to rediscover themselves. There is a lot of things that our eye can't catch and sometimes a second pair of eyes is highly recommended!

Written with React and styled components. I used Context API for the global state.

Due to the fact that I was experimenting with the design of the website, RWD is not implemented for now, but working on it. Still under development, but I will add more things whenever I find some time ;)
